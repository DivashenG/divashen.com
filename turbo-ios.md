Native apps are hard. They are expensive to build and even more expensive to maintain.

What if that wasnâ€™t the case? What if every time you built a new workflow in your Rails app, your mobile app got that feature *for free*?

This is possible with [Turbo](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios/), a small framework from the geniuses at Basecamp. Follow this series of posts to learn how to build a hybrid iOS app from scratch. All you need is a mobile website powered by Ruby on Rails.

## [1. The Turbo framework]({% post_url turbo-ios/2021-02-18-the-turbo-framework %})

This introduction covers the benefits of hybrid apps and how Turbo helps bridge the gap between web and native. It also breaks down the code in the Quick Start guide from the Turbo wiki line by line. A perfect place to start for those new to Turbo or hybrid in general.
