> "Just wrapped at Joe's first Turbo Native workshop. **Money well spent.** His workshop was huge in helping me wrap some concepts together." - [Mike Monroe](https://twitter.com/mikepmunroe/status/1603513381599715336)

Native apps are hard. Theyâ€™re expensive to build and even more expensive to maintain. But with Turbo Native, thatâ€™s no longer true.

The framework enables Rails developers like you and me to build high-fidelity hybrid apps with native navigation in a fraction of the time.

Turbo Native unlocks native apps for Rails developers in a way that avoids a maintenance nightmare. Adding a new feature to your Rails app is automatically available to your native apps â€” no rebuilding or resubmitting needed. And since youâ€™re building mobile web views thereâ€™s not another framework or library to learn once you have Turbo Native set up.

The interactive workshop will be 2 hours long. You'll learn how to use the [turbo-ios](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-ios) adapter to build high-fidelity hybrid apps with native navigation.

## What you'll get out of this workshop

**How to use Turbo Native** - The steps to integrate the framework into a new Xcode project.

**How to navigate** - Add Turbo Navigator to handle the most important navigation flows.

**How to progressively enhance** - Uncover hidden Rails helpers to work with Turbo Native.

**How to authenticate users** - Ensure users remain signed in between launches.

**How to add native components** - Use Strada to build Swift components driven by HTML.

> "Great pace and content, and opportunity to get clarification on some key concepts real time was priceless. **Highly recommended**!" ðŸ’¯ - [Miles](https://twitter.com/tapster/status/1681582444707807234)

## Resources

A good portion of the workshop is live coding â€“Â sometimes I'll be driving and other times you will be given prompts to complete with other attendees. The session will have one break and wrap up with Q&A.

Attendees will also receive:

**iOS + Rails codebases** - Access to private GitHub repositories to work through during the workshop. Together, these build the groundwork for launching your own Turbo Native app.

**Turbo Native community** - A Discord server invitation to discuss Turbo Native and the take home activities with other attendees and myself.

## About the author

Hi, I'm Joe! I've been working with Turbo Native since 2015.

I've helped dozens of businesses launch in the App Store. I know the gotchas, trade offs, and best practices. I'm excited to share what I've learned so you can launch your own app with Turbo Native.

Have questions about the workshop? [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com).

## Prerequisites

All attendees must be able to run a Ruby on Rails app and Xcode on their machine, clone a git repository, and navigate between git branches/tags.

They must also have a basic understanding of Swift and iOS development. You should be comfortable working with optionals, protocols, delegates, extensions, and UIKit classes like `UIViewController` and `UINavigationController`.

Read through <%= link_to "Swift for Ruby developers", "_posts/2023-04-25-swift-for-ruby-developers.md" %> to get up to speed.
