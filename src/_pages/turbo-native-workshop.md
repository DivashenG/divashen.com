> "Just wrapped at Joe's first Turbo Native workshop. **Money well spent.** His workshop was huge in helping me wrap some concepts together." - [Mike Monroe](https://twitter.com/mikepmunroe/status/1603513381599715336)

As a Rails developer, Turbo Native is your shortcut to creating native apps. It lets you code once and deploy everywhere, using mobile web views in native frames.

The problem? The official docs are sparse and there aren't many examples out there.

## What you'll get out of this workshop

You'll learn everything you need to know to get started with Turbo Native on iOS:

1.  **How to use Turbo Native** - The steps to integrate the framework into a Xcode project.
1.  **How to navigate** - Add Turbo Navigator to handle the most important navigation flows.
1.  **How to progressively enhance** - Uncover hidden Rails helpers to work with native.
1.  **How to authenticate users** - Ensure users remain signed in between launches.
1.  **How to add native components** - Use Strada for Swift components driven by HTML.

> "Great pace and content, and opportunity to get clarification on some key concepts real time was priceless. **Highly recommended**!" ðŸ’¯ - [Miles](https://twitter.com/tapster/status/1681582444707807234)

## Format

The 2-hour session combines live coding with hands-on exercises.

There'll be a short break and a Q&A session at the end.

## Extras

You'll also get:

* **iOS + Rails codebases** - The groundwork for launching your own Turbo Native app.
* **Turbo Native community** - Access to a Discord server to discuss Turbo Native.
