<p class="lead">Thank you for subscribing to my newsletter. ❤️</p>

I have so much to share with you.

I'm Joe Masilotti. That's my mug right over there. I help folks launch iOS apps in the App Store with Turbo Native and Ruby on Rails. I'm also the solo-founder of [RailsDevs](https://railsdevs.com).

All my emails will come from this address: [joe@masilotti.com](mailto:joe@masilotti.com). Make sure to check your inbox to verify your email address.

In the meantime, here are my 3 favorite things I've ever written:

1. [Hybrid iOS apps with Turbo](https://masilotti.com/turbo-ios/)
2. [Zero to App Store in 7 weeks](https://masilotti.com/zero-to-app-store-in-7-weeks/)
3. [How I took my SaaS from idea to sold in 14 months](https://masilotti.com/idea-to-sold-in-14-months/)

Also, don't be shy! I'd love to hear from you.

Can you take a moment to introduce yourself and tell me how you found my writing? That way, I can tailor my work to your interests.

And in the future, if you ever want to say hello, contacting me is as easy as replying to one of my emails.

Once again, thank you for subscribing.

Chat soon,<br>Joe Masilotti
