The "Masilotti.com Umbrella", as I like to call it, contains a few different areas of focus.

### Consulting

First is consulting, where I help teams design, build, test, and deploy their products. Primarily Ruby on Rails sites, native iOS apps, and Turbolinks-powered hybrid mobile apps.

My focus is clean, testable code and integrating into a company as much as possible. Expect to see me in your Slack and weekly meetings!

I also work full stack across all disciplines, tackling anything from Sidekiq background jobs to front-end Stimulus controllers. Or building the JSON API and SwiftUI app in concert.

### Coaching

Pair programming is the quickest way to level up your development skills. I take this to heart and offer live, 1:1 coaching in Ruby on Rails, iOS, and general testing best practices.

These sessions range from teaching SwiftUI to new iOS developers to coaching entire teams on high-level architecture. Occasionally, I run group sessions on specific topics, like UI Testing or Swift mocks.

### Products

My primary focus is [Mugshot Bot](https://www.mugshotbot.com?utm_source=masilotti.com), a zero effort social image generator. Plug in a URL and it spits out a beautifully designed, perfectly sized image to share on Facebook and Twitter. You can even point your `og:image` tag directly to Mugshot Bot's servers.

On iOS I run a board game companion app for X-Wing, [X-Wing AI](https://xwing.app?utm_source=masilotti.com). The app simulates a human opponent with a believable yet unpredictable AI. This has been a huge welcome for a game that usually requires at least two people to play!

Continuing the board game trend, I'm the founder of [weTabletop](https://www.wetabletop.com/remote-events?utm_source=masilotti.com), a directory for remote board game events. You can also track your played games with [beautiful pictures of the board](https://www.wetabletop.com/journals?utm_source=masilotti.com").
