I'm currently working with [Zaarly](https://zaarly.com) helping them fine-tune their iOS apps. I built their iOS and Android apps a few years ago we've been working together ever since.

Previously, at [BeerMenus](https://www.beermenus.com) I was responsible for building and maintaining the website and native apps. I was also responsible for evaluating and integrating all infrastructure changes, performance improvements, and automated testing.

Before working at BeerMenus, I spent a few years learning how to test code with [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com). While there I worked on some amazing products including [Cue by Humana](https://press.humana.com/press-release/current-releases/cue-humana-gives-consumers-simple-health-reminders-apple-watch), MyHealth by Humana, and [InSite](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/06/19/insite-app-works-to-connect-you-on-and-offline.html).

On the side, I'm the founder of [weTabletop](https://www.wetabletop.com/remote-events), a directory for remote board game events. If you love board games then check it out! You can also track your played games with [beautiful pictures of the board](https://www.wetabletop.com/journals").

I also host a live web session on testing in Swift every month. Last session we had eight developers join and learn about protocols and mocking! [Send me an email](mailto:joe@masilotti.com) if you want to join next time.
