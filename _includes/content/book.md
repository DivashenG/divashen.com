Native apps are hard. They are expensive to build and even more expensive to maintain.

But what if that wasnâ€™t the case? What if every time you built a new workflow in your Rails app, your mobile apps got that feature for free?

This is possible with Turbo Native. And this book will teach you how to build high-fidelity, low-maintenance iOS and Android apps drive by your Rails server.

You won't need any Kotlin or Swift experience to get started, just some Rails experience.

## Readers will learn...

1. **Confidence across platforms**: Hybrid apps are most impactful when launched across multiple platforms. Readers will learn how to build for web, iOS, and Android.
2. **The Turbo Native mindset**: Building effective Turbo Native apps means leaving as much business logic as possible on the server. Readers will learn how to create low-maintenance, server-drive apps.
3. **Native vs. web**: Building native screens and components requires a lot more effort to build and maintain. But sometimes the additional fidelity is worth it. Readers will learn when it makes sense to upgrade to native.
4. **Any SDK and any API**: One of the biggest benefits of mobile apps is access to the underlying platform SDKs and APIs not available on the web. Readers will learn the building blocks so they can interact with any native interface, current or future.
5. **Turbo Native pitfalls and gotchas**: Hybrid still has some trade-offs. Readers will learn where it falls short and what to watch out for when building their apps.
