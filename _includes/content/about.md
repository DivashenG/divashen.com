<p class="lead mt-12"> A friendly neighbourhood programmer…? A star-struck star gazer…? A local ex-kook…? Yes! </p>

I'm an Astrophysicist turned Software Engineer that loves problem solving, surfing and just being a general pleasant human being! When I’m not glued to a computer screen, coding or gaming, you’ll find me out at backline, chasing those green waves!

I have lots of opinions on legacy code, longboards & life that I can’t wait to share with you.
